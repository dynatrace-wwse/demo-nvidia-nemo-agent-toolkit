## 🚀 Using Codespaces

1. **Start a Codespace**

    Once you have your the secrets for Dynatrace, Tavily, and NVIDIA startup codespaces.

    1. Click `Code` and `Codespaces` tab
    1. Click `New with options`
    1. Enter Secrets for Dynatrace, Tavily, and NVIDIA
    1. Click `Create codespace`

1. **Wait for App to start**

    It will take a minute or so for Codespaces to start, the installation to take place, and the App to open.  It should like as follows when it is done.

1. **Open App**

    Once the browser opens, it will take a few seconds before the application is initialized so a blank page is OK at first then the prompt will appear.

1. **Validate Distributed Tracing in Dynatrace**

    Go back to the [Distributed Tracing App](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/application-observability/distributed-tracing/distributed-tracing-app) in Dynatrace
    * Can you find your request with Guardrails?
    * How many guardrail checks were activated? What is the total response time of your request?
    * BONUS: Can you find  span attributes specifically related to Guardrails?

1. **Explore the AI Observability App in Dynatrace**

    Open the Dynatrace Tenant and go to the [AI Observability App](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/dynatrace-for-ai-observability/ai-observability-app)
    * Explore the various LLM metrics in the Overview Tab
    * Guardrails, Agent Topology, Model Versioning, and more!

## 🚀 Installation locally

### Setup environment variables 

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Create Environment Variables file**

    Make an environment file using the provided environment variable template:

    ```bash
    cp .env-app-template .env
    ```
3. **Set Tavily API Key**

    - Create a Tavily API KEY API Key on [tavily.com](https://www.tavily.com)
    - Adjust `.env` with your Tavily API Key for `TAVILY_API_KEY`
    - Once set, you can review your API usage with this command.
        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
            --url https://api.tavily.com/usage  \
            --header "Authorization: Bearer $TAVILY_API_KEY" | jq .
        ```

4. **Set NVIDIA API Key**

    - Create a NVIDIA API Key on [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com)
    - Adjust `.env` with your NVIDIA API Key for `NVIDIA_API_KEY`

5. **Create Dynatrace API Key**

    - Adjust `.env` with your Dynatrace environment `DT_BASE_URL` and `DT_API_TOKEN`

### Start an OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector will send observability data to Dynatrace. For this, follow the [OTLP receiver only setup guide](../otel/README.md)

### Run the Application locally using Python

1. **Create virtual environment**

    ```
    uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Update the NVIDIA configuration files**
    
    This script will create the `guardrails_config/config.yml` and `src/configs/config.yml` files from the provided template for NVIDIA build API usage required for NVIDIA NAT and Guardrail usage.

    ```bash
    source .env
    python update_config.py build
    ```

4. **Start sample App**

    This will start a web app on port `8501` for example `http://localhost:8501`

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

5. **Open App**

    Start app which will open the web UI in a local browser at `http://localhost:5801`
