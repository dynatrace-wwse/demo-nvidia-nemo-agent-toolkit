[ ] Adapt greeting to no Kubernetes Cluster, same as Azure WebApp Repo.


Documentation
[ ] have better guidance, like this  https://dynatrace-wwse.github.io/enablement-gen-ai-llm-observability/ with explanations, should be self-service. bring more customers and prospects! we should wow them.
[ ] Documentation on getting the token,
  - LLM token better like this: https://dynatrace-wwse.github.io/enablement-gen-ai-llm-observability/2-getting-started/

 Refactor Vars to 
  [ ] "DT_ENVIRONMENT": {"description": "URL to your Dynatrace Platform eg. https://abc123.apps.dynatrace.com or for sprint -> https://abc123.sprint.apps.dynatracelabs.com"
  [ ] "DT_LLM_TOKEN": {"description": "Dynatrace API token with these permissions: Ingest events, Ingest logs, Ingest metrics, Ingest OpenTelemetry traces"
  [ ] clear writing to bashrc and move -> .zshrc or .env

Improve Dev Experience
[x] Start app in backgrpund and manage process with PID (release terminal)
[x] Stop app with PID
[x] Init app
[x] Pipe log std errand std output to logfile
[x] function to read App log with "less +F" 
[x] function to read Otel log with "less +F"

[ ] Protect branch with git strategy
[ ] Version policy

## 🚀 Demo Overview

This repository is a **demo project** showcasing the **NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit** with **Dynatrace integration**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/dt-nvidia.png" width="50%">
</p>


It is intended for hands-on exploration of how agent-based AI workflows can be built, run, and observed in a practical setup. With this demo, you can:

- run and inspect an agent-based AI implementation using NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit  
- observe behavior, telemetry, and AI monitoring signals with Dynatrace  
- use a structured example that can be adapted for workshops, demos, or technical walkthroughs  

Use this README to understand the demo scope, architecture, and expected outcomes.
